EPA staff are meeting with every state drinking water program across the country to ensure that states are taking appropriate actions to address lead action level exceedances; including optimizing corrosion control, providing effective health communication and outreach to residents on steps to reduce exposures to lead; and removing lead service lines where required by the LCR.

We will also be conducting training for state and public water systems staff to ensure that all water systems understand how to carry out the requirements of the LCR properly . Finally, we are working to revise and strengthen the LCR; but those revisions will take time to propose and finalize; our current expectation is that proposed revisions will be issued in 2017.
